# Changelog

## [1.1.16] - 2025-08-03
### Fixed
- **SpecStory integration debug** - investigated issue with not displaying last 3 prompts from SpecStory file
- **Path detection** - extension looks for SpecStory files in workspace but user has them in different location
- **Czech language support** - confirmed that SpecStory content can contain Czech text (only code/docs must be English)

### Investigation
- **Found issue**: extension searches for `.specstory/history` in workspace folders only
- **User's files location**: `C:\Proj_Net\portal-ui\.specstory\history\2025-08-03_07-59Z-user-greeting-and-request-for-assistance.md`
- **Solution**: need to configure `specstoryautosave.specstoryHistoryPath` setting to point to correct path
